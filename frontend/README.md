## üõ†Ô∏è Future features

- I'm planning to create a Rails API.
    - So we can allow the users manage their selling accounts.
    - Then users can publish their items.
    - When users complete a buy with a shopping cart, the app put the shopper in contact with all the sellers with an automated whatsapp message.
    - Now people can sell and buy real items.
    - We could add an option to restrict interactions of users by the same contry so deals can be made easily
